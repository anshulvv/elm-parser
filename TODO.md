# TODOs

## PRIORITY

1. DeadEnd to String sucks. Find a better way to deal with that. Probably return a custom error message
Write the custom error messages in a separate file ErrorMessages.elm and show on errors.

2. Make List Int more generic to support List (Type) instead by taking a parser of the type
and parsing a list 
we can add more features like adding a delimeter or something else but it will start to look similar to *Test.sequence*

## Horizontals
1. Add some more tests to list int, which may break the list int function

2. Find way of selecting from a list of parsers and highlighting the parsers
